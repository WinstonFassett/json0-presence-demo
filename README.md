This application was originally authored by [Stian HÃ¥klev](https://github.com/houshuang) in [github.com/houshuang/presence-demo](https://github.com/houshuang/presence-demo). The original application was simplified by Curran Kelleher down to a single `textarea` with presence. The purpose of this simplified version is provide a more minimal example to demonstrate that the [Presence work on json0](https://github.com/ottypes/json0/pull/31) functions within an integrated system.

To run locally:
