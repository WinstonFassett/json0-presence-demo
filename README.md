# json0-presence-demo

A demo of presence cursors with json0 and ShareDB.

This application was originally authored by [Stian HÃ¥klev](https://github.com/houshuang) in [github.com/houshuang/presence-demo](https://github.com/houshuang/presence-demo). The original application was simplified down to a single `textarea` with presence by Curran Kelleher to provide a more minimal example to demonstrate that the [Presence work on json0](https://github.com/ottypes/json0/pull/31) functions within an integrated system.

To run locally:

```
npm install
npm run build && npm start
```
